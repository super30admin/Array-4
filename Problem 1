#Array Partition

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the input array nums. However, it's the most efficient approach to solve this problem. 
The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

class Solution:
    def arrayPairSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()  # Sort the array
        total_sum = 0
        
        # Pair consecutive elements starting from index 0
        for i in range(0, len(nums), 2):
            total_sum += nums[i]
        
        return total_sum
