/**
 * From 2nd last index, we search if there is any index i, such that nums[i] < nums[i+1].
 * If yes, we replace the number at index, i with immediate greater element than nums[i] lies between i+1 and end of array
 * Once, we have replaced, we reverse the elements from i+1 to end of array.
 * We do this because, next greater number will be formed, by replacing 1st smallest digit from right to left, by 2nd smallest digit from right to left
 * And after replacement, we want 1st smallest to come next to 2nd smallest digit
 * And since elements are decreasing order after index i, we reverse them all to form lexicographically next greater number
 * If we dont get breach at all, then we just reverse all the digits
